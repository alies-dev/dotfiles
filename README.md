It contains the installation of some basic tools, some handy aliases and functions. Backups of settings are done via [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup).

You can install them by cloning the repository as `.dotfiles` in your home directory and running the bootstrap script.

cd ~
git clone git@github.com:lptn/dotfiles.git .dotfiles

The bootstrap script can be run by cd-ing into the `.dotfiles` directory and performing this command:
